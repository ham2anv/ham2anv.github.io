<h2 id="dice-notation">DICE NOTATION</h2>
<p>These rules use the following die notations:</p>
<ul>
<li>d4 = four sided die</li>
<li>d6 = six sided die</li>
<li>d8 = eight sided die</li>
<li>d10 = ten sided die</li>
<li>d12 = twelve sided die</li>
<li>d20 = twenty sided die</li>
<li>d% = percentile dice (a number between 1 and 100 is generated by rolling
two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before rolling) is the
tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Die rolls are expressed in the format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[#][die type][+/- modifiers]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em>: 3d6+2 means: &quot;Roll 3 six sided dice. Add the result of the
three dice together. Add 2.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="rounding-fractions">ROUNDING FRACTIONS</h2>
<p>In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the
fraction is one-half or larger.</p>
<p><em>Exception</em>: Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a minimum
of 1.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="multiplying">MULTIPLYING</h2>
<p>Sometimes a special rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As
long as you&#39;re applying a single multiplier, multiply the number
normally. When two or more multipliers apply, however, combine them into
a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value
to the first multiple. Thus, a double (x2) and a double (x2) applied to
the same number results in a triple (x3, because 2 + 1 = 3).</p>
<h1 id="basic-task-resolution-system">BASIC TASK RESOLUTION SYSTEM</h1>
<p>These rules assume a standardized system for determining the success or
failure of any given task. That system is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d20 + Modifiers vs. Target Number</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Modifiers and Target Number are determined by the type of task.</p>
<p>If the result of the d20 roll + the Modifiers equals or exceeds the
Target Number, the test is successful. Any other result is a failure.</p>
<p>A &quot;natural 20&quot; on the die roll is not an automatic success. A
&quot;natural 1&quot; on the die roll is not an automatic failure, unless the
rules state otherwise.</p>
