<h3 id="starting-feats">Starting Feats</h3>
<p>In addition to the two feats all characters get at 1st level, a
Charismatic hero begins play with the Simple Weapons Proficiency feat.</p>
<h3 id="class-features">Class Features</h3>
<p>All of the following are class features of the Charismatic hero.</p>
<h3 id="talents">Talents</h3>
<p>At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the Charismatic hero selects a
talent from the following talent trees. Some trees have a set order that
must be followed, while others provide a list to choose from. As long as
the hero qualifies, he or she can select freely from any and all talent
trees. No talent can be selected more than once unless expressly
indicated.</p>
<h3 id="charm-talent-tree">Charm Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Charismatic hero has an innate talent for being charming and
captivating.</p>
<p><strong>Charm</strong>: The Charismatic hero gets a competence bonus on all
Charisma-based skill checks made to influence members of his chosen
gender. (Some characters are charming to members of the opposite gender,
others to members of the same gender.) The bonus is equal to the
character&#39;s Charismatic level.</p>
<p>A Charismatic hero can only charm Gamemaster characters with attitudes
of indifferent or better. The charm bonus can&#39;t be used against
characters who are unfriendly or hostile.</p>
<p>This ability can be taken more than once (for another gender).</p>
<p><strong>Favor</strong>: The Charismatic hero has the ability to acquire minor aid
from anyone he or she meets. By making a favor check, a Charismatic hero
can gain important information without going through the time and
trouble of doing a lot of research. Favors can also be used to acquire
the loan of equipment or documents, or to receive other minor assistance
in the course of an adventure.</p>
<p>A Charismatic hero spends 1 action point to activate this talent. To
make a favor check, roll a d20 and add the character&#39;s favor bonus,
equal to the character&#39;s Charismatic level. The GM sets the DC based on
the scope of the favor being requested. The DC ranges from 10 for a
simple favor to as high as 30 for formidable and highly dangerous,
expensive, or illegal favors. A Charismatic hero can&#39;t take 10 or 20 on
this check, nor can the hero retry the check for the same (or virtually
the same) favor. Favors should help advance the plot of an adventure. A
favor that would enable a character to avoid an adventure altogether
should always be unavailable to the character, regardless of the result
of a favor check.</p>
<p>The GM should carefully monitor a Charismatic hero&#39;s use of favors to
ensure that this ability isn&#39;t abused. The success or failure of a
mission shouldn&#39;t hinge on the use of a favor, and getting a favor
shouldn&#39;t replace good roleplaying or the use of other skills. The GM
may disallow any favor deemed to be disruptive to the game.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Charm.</p>
<p><strong>Captivate</strong>: The Charismatic hero has the ability to temporarily
beguile a target through the use of words and bearing. The target must
have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher to be susceptible to a
captivate attempt, must be within 30 feet of the hero, must be
flat-footed or not in combat, and must be able to see, hear, and
understand the hero.</p>
<p>To captivate a target, the hero must use an attack action and make a
Charisma check (DC 15), adding his or her Charismatic level as a bonus.
If the Charisma check succeeds, the target can try to resist.</p>
<p>The target resists the captivation attempt by making a Will saving throw
(DC 10 + Charismatic hero&#39;s class level + Charismatic hero&#39;s Cha bonus).
If the saving throw fails, the hero becomes the target&#39;s sole focus. The
target pays no attention to anyone else for 1 round and remains
flat-footed. This focusing of the target&#39;s attention allows other
characters to take actions of which the captivated target is unaware.
The effect ends immediately if the target is attacked or threatened.</p>
<p>A Charismatic hero can concentrate to keep a target captivated for
additional rounds. The Charismatic hero concentrates all his or her
effort on the task, and the target gets to make a new Will save each
round. The effect ends when the hero stops concentrating, or when the
target succeeds on the save. This is a Mind-Affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Charm, Favor.</p>
<h3 id="fast-talk-talent-tree">Fast-Talk Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Charismatic hero has an innate talent for bending the truth and
dazzling others with a combination of words, mannerisms, and charm.</p>
<p><strong>Fast-Talk</strong>: The Charismatic hero has a way with words when attempting
to con and deceive. With this talent, he or she applies his or her
Charismatic level as a competence bonus on any Bluff, Diplomacy, or
Gamble checks the hero makes while attempting to lie, cheat, or
otherwise bend the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Dazzle</strong>: The Charismatic hero has the ability to dazzle a target
through sheer force of personality, a winning smile, and fast-talking.
The target must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher to be
susceptible to a dazzle attempt, must be within 30 feet of the hero, and
must be able to see, hear, and understand the hero.</p>
<p>To dazzle a target, the hero must use an attack action and make a
Charisma check (DC 15), adding his or her Charismatic level as a bonus.
If the Charisma check succeeds, the target can try to resist.</p>
<p>The target resists the dazzle attempt by making a Will saving throw (DC
10 + Charismatic hero&#39;s class level + Charismatic hero&#39;s Cha bonus). If
the save fails, the target receives a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls,
ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for a number of rounds
equal to the character&#39;s Charismatic level.</p>
<p>This talent can be selected multiple times, each time worsening the
dazzled penalty by &ndash;1. This is a Mind-Affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Fast-talk.</p>
<p><strong>Taunt</strong>: The Charismatic hero has the ability to temporarily rattle a
target through the use of insults and goading. The target must have an
Intelligence score of 3 or higher to be susceptible to a taunt, must be
within 30 feet of the hero, and must be able to hear and understand the
hero.</p>
<p>To taunt a target, the hero must use an attack action and make a
Charisma check (DC 15), adding his or her Charismatic level as a bonus.
If the Charisma check succeeds, the target can try to resist.</p>
<p>The target resists the taunt by making a Will saving throw (DC 10 +
Charismatic hero&#39;s class level + Charismatic hero&#39;s Cha bonus). If the
save fails, the target becomes dazed (unable to act, but can defend
normally) for 1 round.</p>
<p>A taunt can be played on an opponent any number of times. This is a
Mind-Affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Fast-talk, dazzle.</p>
<h3 id="leadership-talent-tree">Leadership Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Charismatic hero has a talent for leadership and inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinate</strong>: The Charismatic hero has a knack for getting people to
work together. When the hero can spend a full round directing his or her
allies and makes a Charisma check (DC 10), the hero provides any of his
or her allies within 30 feet a +1 bonus on their attack rolls and skill
checks. The bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the hero&#39;s
Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>The hero can coordinate a number of allies equal to one-half his or her
Charismatic level, rounded down (to a minimum of one ally).</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>: The Charismatic hero can inspire his or her allies,
bolstering them and improving their chances of success. An ally must
listen to and observe the Charismatic hero for a full round for the
inspiration to take hold, and the hero must make a Charisma check (DC
10). The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the hero&#39;s
Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>An inspired ally gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls,
and damage rolls.</p>
<p>A Charismatic hero can&#39;t inspire him or herself. The hero can inspire a
number of allies equal to one-half his or her Charismatic level, rounded
down (to a minimum of one ally).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Coordinate.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Inspiration</strong>: The Charismatic hero can inspire his or her
allies to even greater heights, bolstering them and improving their
chances of success. An ally must listen to and observe the Charismatic
hero for a full round for the greater inspiration to take hold, and the
hero must make a Charisma check (DC 10). The effect lasts for a number
of rounds equal to the hero&#39;s Charisma modifier.</p>
<p>An inspired ally gains an additional +1 morale bonus on saving throws,
attack rolls, and damage rolls, which stacks with the bonus from
inspiration for a total of a +3 morale bonus.</p>
<p>A Charismatic hero can&#39;t inspire him or herself. The hero can inspire a
number of allies equal to one-half his or her Charismatic level, rounded
down (to a minimum of one ally).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Coordinate, inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-feats">Bonus Feats</h3>
