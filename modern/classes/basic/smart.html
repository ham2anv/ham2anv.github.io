<h3 id="starting-feats">Starting Feats</h3>
<p>In addition to the two feats all characters get at 1st level, a Smart
hero begins play with the Simple Weapons Proficiency feat.</p>
<h3 id="talents">Talents</h3>
<p>At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the Smart hero selects a talent
from the following talent trees. Some trees have a set order that must
be followed, while others provide a list to choose from. As long as the
hero qualifies, he or she can select freely from any and all talent
trees. No talent can be selected more than once unless expressly
indicated.</p>
<h3 id="research-talent-tree">Research Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Smart hero has a natural aptitude for study and fact-finding. These
talents can be selected in any order.</p>
<p><strong>Savant</strong>: Select one of the skills listed in the following paragraph.
The hero must have ranks in the skill if it is Trained Only. The Smart
hero gets to add a bonus equal to his or her Smart level when making
checks with that skill. A Smart hero can take this talent multiple
times; each time it applies to a different skill.</p>
<p>Computer Use, Craft (any single skill), Decipher Script, Demolitions,
Disable Device, Forgery, Investigate, Knowledge (any single skill),
Navigate, Repair, Research, Search.</p>
<p><strong>Linguist</strong>: With this talent, the Smart hero becomes a master
linguist. Whenever the hero encounters a new language, either spoken or
written, that he or she does not know the Smart hero can make an
Intelligence check to determine if he or she can understand it. The
check is made with a bonus equal to the hero&#39;s Smart level. For a
written language, the bonus applies to a Decipher Script check instead.</p>
<p>The DC for the check depends on the situation: DC 15 if the language is
in the same group as a language the hero has as a Read/Write Language or
Speak Language skill; DC 20 if the language is unrelated to any other
languages the hero knows; and DC 25 if the language is ancient or
unique. With this special ability, a Smart hero can glean enough meaning
from a conversation or document to ascertain the basic message, but this
ability in no way simulates actually being able to converse or fluently
read and write in a given language.</p>
<p>A single check covers roughly one minute of a spoken language or one
page of a written language.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: At least 1 rank in either Read/Write Language or Speak
Language for each of three different languages.</p>
<h3 id="strategy-talent-tree">Strategy Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Smart hero has the brainpower to see solutions in most situations.
These talents can be selected in any order, but before the hero can
select a talent from this tree he or she must have previously selected
at least one talent from the Research Talent Tree.</p>
<p><strong>Exploit Weakness</strong>: After 1 round of combat, the Smart hero can
designate one opponent and try to find ways to gain an advantage by
using brains over brawn. The Smart hero uses a move action and makes an
Intelligence check (DC 15) with a bonus equal to his or her Smart level.
If the check succeeds, for the rest of the combat the Smart hero uses
his or her Intelligence bonus instead of either Strength or Dexterity
bonus on attack rolls as the hero finds ways to outthink his opponent
and notices weaknesses in his opponent&#39;s fighting style.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: One talent from the Research Talent Tree.</p>
<p><strong>Plan</strong>: Prior to an encounter the Smart hero can develop a plan of
action to handle the situation. Using this talent requires preparation;
a Smart hero can&#39;t use this talent when surprised or otherwise
unprepared for a particular situation. Creating a plan requires 1
minute.</p>
<p>After creating the plan the Smart hero makes an Intelligence check (DC 10) with a bonus equal to his or her Smart level. The result of the
check provides the Smart hero and allies with a circumstance bonus. A
Smart hero can&#39;t take 10 or 20 when making this check.</p>

<p>This bonus can be applied to all skill checks and attack rolls made by
the Smart hero and his or her allies, but the bonus only lasts for the
first 3 rounds after making the plan. After that time, reduce the bonus
by 1 point (to a minimum of +0) for every additional round the situation
continues, as the vagaries of circumstance begin to unravel even the
best-laid plans.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: One talent from the Research Talent Tree.</p>
<p><strong>Trick</strong>: The Smart hero has the ability to temporarily confuse a
target through the use of ploy and deception. The target must have an
Intelligence score of 3 or higher to be susceptible to a trick, must be
within 30 feet of the hero, and must be able to hear and understand the
hero.</p>
<p>To play a trick on a target, the hero must use a full-round action and
make an Intelligence check (DC 15), adding his or her Smart level as a
bonus. If the Intelligence check succeeds, the target can try to think
quickly and ignore the trick.</p>
<p>The target resists the trick by making a Will saving throw (DC 10 +
Smart hero&#39;s class level + Smart hero&#39;s Int bonus). If the saving throw
fails, the target becomes dazed (unable to act, but can defend normally)
for 1 round.</p>
<p>A trick can only be played on a particular target once per encounter.
After the first trick in an encounter, whether the attempt succeeds or
not, that target becomes wary and immune to such ploys. This is a
mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: One talent from the Research Talent Tree.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-feats">Bonus Feats</h3>
<p>At 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, the Smart hero gains a bonus

hero must meet any prerequisites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Builder, Cautious, Combat Expertise, Educated, Gearhead, Improved
