<h3 id="starting-feats">Starting Feats</h3>
<p>In addition to the two feats all characters get at 1st level, a Tough
hero begins play with the Simple Weapons Proficiency feat.</p>
<h3 id="talents">Talents</h3>
<p>At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the Tough hero selects a talent
from the following talent trees. Some trees have a set order that must
be followed, while others provide a list to choose from. As long as the
hero qualifies, he or she can select freely from any and all talent
trees. No talent can be selected more than once unless expressly
indicated.</p>
<h3 id="damage-reduction-talent-tree">Damage Reduction Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Tough hero has an innate talent to ignore a set amount of damage
from most weapons, but not from energy or special attack forms (which
may or may not exist, depending on the campaign). Before the hero can
select a talent from this tree the hero must have previously selected at
least one talent from the Energy Resistance or Unbreakable Talent Tree.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Reduction 1/---</strong>: The Tough hero ignores 1 point of damage
from melee and ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Prerequisite: One other talent from either the Energy Resistance Talent
Tree or the Unbreakable Talent Tree.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Reduction 2/---</strong>: The Tough hero ignores an additional 1 point
of damage from melee and ranged weapons (DR 2/--- total).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Damage reduction 1/---, one other talent from either
the Energy Resistance Talent Tree or the Unbreakable Talent Tree.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Reduction 3/---</strong>: The Tough hero ignores an additional 1 point
of damage from melee and ranged weapons (DR 3/--- total).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Damage reduction 1/---, damage reduction 2/---, one
other talent from either the Energy Resistance Talent Tree or the
Unbreakable Talent Tree.</p>
<h3 id="energy-resistance-talent-tree">Energy Resistance Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Tough hero is particularly resistant to certain kinds of deadly
energy effects. These talents can be selected in any order.</p>
<p><strong>Acid Resistance</strong>: The Tough hero ignores an amount of acid damage
equal to his or her Constitution modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Resistance</strong>: The Tough hero ignores an amount of cold damage
equal to his or her Constitution modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Electricity Resistance</strong>: The Tough hero ignores an amount of
electricity damage equal to his or her Constitution modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Resistance</strong>: The Tough hero ignores an amount of fire damage
equal to his or her Constitution modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Sonic/Concussion Resistance</strong>: The Tough hero ignores an amount of
sonic or concussion damage equal to his or her Constitution modifier.</p>
<h3 id="unbreakable-talent-tree">Unbreakable Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Tough hero is particularly resilient thanks to the following
talents.</p>
<p><strong>Remain Conscious</strong>: The Tough hero gains the ability to continue to
perform actions when he or she would otherwise be considered unconscious
and dying. When the Tough hero&#39;s hit points reach --1, the hero can
perform as though he or she were disabled, making either an attack
action or a move action every round until the hero reaches --10 hit
points (and dies) or the hero&#39;s hit points return to 1 or higher. The
hero can choose to succumb to unconsciousness if he or she thinks that
doing so might prevent him or her from taking more damage.</p>
<p><strong>Robust</strong>: The Tough hero becomes especially robust, gaining a number
of hit points equal to his or her Tough level as soon as he or she
selects this talent. Thereafter, the hero gains +1 hit point with each
level of Tough he or she gains.</p>
<p>Second Wind: The Tough hero can spend 1 action point to gain a second
wind. When the hero does this, he or she recovers a number of hit points
equal to his or her Constitution modifier. This talent does not increase
the Tough hero&#39;s hit points beyond the character&#39;s full normal total.</p>
<p><strong>Stamina</strong>: The Tough hero recovers twice as fast as normal. So, the
hero recovers 2 hit points per character level per evening of rest, 2
points of temporary ability damage per evening of rest, and awakens in
half the normal time after being knocked unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Robust.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-feats">Bonus Feats</h3>
<p>At 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, the Tough hero gains a bonus
feat. This feat must be selected from the following list, and the Tough
hero must meet any prerequisites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alertness, Athletic, Brawl, Confident, Endurance, Great Fortitude,
Improved Brawl, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Feint, Knockout Punch,
Power Attack, Streetfighting, Toughness, Vehicle Expert.</p>
