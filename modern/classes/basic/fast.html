<section>
<h2 id="starting-feats">Starting Feats</h2>
<p>In addition to the two feats all characters get at 1st level, a Fast
hero begins play with the Simple Weapons Proficiency feat.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="class-features">Class Features</h2>
<p>All of the following are class features of the Fast hero.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="talents">Talents</h2>
<p>At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the Fast hero selects a talent
from the following talent trees. Some trees have a set order that must
be followed, while others provide a list to choose from. As long as the
hero qualifies, he or she can select freely from any and all talent
trees. No talent can be selected more than once unless expressly
indicated.</p>
<section>
<h3 id="defensive-talent-tree">Defensive Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Fast hero gains the ability to improve his or her innate defensive
talents as the hero attains new levels.</p>
<p><strong>Evasion</strong>: If the Fast hero is exposed to any effect that normally
allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the
Fast hero suffers no damage if he or she makes a successful saving
throw. Evasion can only be used when wearing light armor or no armor.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Dodge 1</strong>: The Fast hero retains his or her Dexterity bonus to
Defense regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by a hidden
attacker. (The hero still loses his or her Dexterity bonus to Defense if
the hero is immobilized.)</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Evasion.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Dodge 2</strong>: The Fast hero can no longer be flanked; the hero
can react to opponents on opposite sides of him or herself as easily as
he or she can react to a single attacker.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Evasion, uncanny dodge 1.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Roll</strong>: The Fast hero can roll with a potentially lethal
attack to take less damage from it. When the Fast hero would be reduced
to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a ranged or melee
attack), the Fast hero can attempt to roll with the damage.</p>
<p>A Fast hero spends 1 action point to use this talent. Once the point is
spent, the hero makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the
save succeeds, he or she takes only half damage. The Fast hero must be
able to react to the attack to execute a defensive roll---if the hero is
immobilized, he or she can&#39;t use this talent.</p>
<p>Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex
save for half damage, the Fast hero&#39;s evasion talent doesn&#39;t apply to
the defensive roll.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Evasion, uncanny dodge 1.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunist</strong>: The Fast hero can spend 1 action point to use this
talent. Once the point is spent, the hero can make an attack of
opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in
melee by another character. This attack counts as the Fast hero&#39;s attack
of opportunity for that round. Even a Fast hero with the Combat Reflexes
feat can&#39;t use this talent more than once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Evasion.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="increased-speed-talent-tree">Increased Speed Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Fast hero can increase his or her natural base speed.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Speed</strong>: The Fast hero&#39;s base speed increases by 5 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Increased Speed</strong>: The Fast hero&#39;s base speed increases by 5
feet. This talent stacks with increased speed (10 feet total).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Increased speed.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Increased Speed</strong>: The Fast hero&#39;s base speed increases by 5
feet. This talent stacks with increased speed and improved increased
speed (15 feet total).</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Increased speed, improved increased speed.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="bonus-feats">Bonus Feats</h2>
<p>At 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, the Fast hero gains a bonus feat.
This feat must be selected from the following list, and the Fast hero
must meet any prerequisites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acrobatic, Combat Expertise, Combat Throw, Defensive Martial Arts,
Double Tap, Elusive Target, Focused, Improved Disarm, Mobility, Personal
Firearms Proficiency, Point Blank Shot, Stealthy, Weapon Finesse.</p>
