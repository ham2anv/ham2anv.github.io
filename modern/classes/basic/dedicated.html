<h2 id="starting-feats">Starting Feats</h2>
<p>In addition to the two feats all characters get at 1st level, a
Dedicated hero begins play with the Simple Weapons Proficiency feat.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="talents">Talents</h2>
<p>At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, the Dedicated hero selects a
talent from the following talent trees. Some trees have a set order that
must be followed, while others provide a list to choose from. As long as
the hero qualifies, he or she can select freely from any and all talent
trees. No talent can be selected more than once unless expressly
indicated.</p>
<section>
<h3 id="empathic-talent-tree">Empathic Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Dedicated hero&#39;s innate talents give him or her a great capacity for
empathy.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy</strong>: The Dedicated hero has a knack for being sensitive to the
feelings and thoughts of others without having those feelings and
thoughts communicated in any objectively explicit manner. This innate
talent provides a bonus on checks involving interaction skills (Bluff,
Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, and Sense Motive),
provided the hero spends at least 1 minute observing his or her target
prior to making the skill check. The bonus is equal to the hero&#39;s
Dedicated level.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Aid Another</strong>: The Dedicated hero&#39;s bonus on attempts to aid
another increases by +1 on a successful aid another check. This talent
can be selected multiple times, each time increasing the bonus by +1.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Empathy.</p>
<p><strong>Intuition</strong>: The Dedicated hero has an innate ability to sense trouble
in the air. The Dedicated hero can make a Will saving throw (DC 15). On
a successful save, the hero gets a hunch that everything is all right,
or the hero gets a bad feeling about a specific situation, based on the
GM&#39;s best guess relating to the circumstances. This talent is usable a
number of times per day equal to the character&#39;s Dedicated level.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Empathy.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="healing-talent-tree">Healing Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Dedicated hero has a talent for healing.</p>
<p><strong>Healing Knack</strong>: The hero has a knack for the healing arts. The hero
receives a +2 bonus on all Treat Injury skill checks.</p>
<p><strong>Healing Touch 1</strong>: The Dedicated hero&#39;s ability to restore damage with
a medical kit or perform surgery with a surgery kit increases by +2 hit
points.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Healing knack.</p>
<p><strong>Healing Touch 2</strong>: The Dedicated hero&#39;s ability to restore damage with
a medical kit or perform surgery with a surgery kit increases by +2 hit
points, which stacks with healing touch 1 for a total of +4 hit points.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Healing knack, healing touch 1.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="insightful-talent-tree">Insightful Talent Tree</h3>
<p>The Dedicated hero&#39;s innate insightfulness serves her well.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Emphasis</strong>: The Dedicated hero chooses a single skill and
receives a +3 bonus on all checks with that skill. This bonus does not
allow the hero to make checks for a trained-only skill if the hero has
no ranks in the skill.</p>
<p><strong>Aware</strong>: The Dedicated hero is intuitively aware of his or her
surroundings. The hero adds his or her base Will saving throw bonus to
Listen or Spot checks to avoid surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Skill emphasis.</p>
<p><strong>Faith</strong>: The Dedicated hero has a great deal of faith. It might be
faith in self, in a higher power, or in both. This unswerving belief
allows the Dedicated hero to add his or her Wisdom modifier to the die
roll whenever the hero spends 1 action point to improve the result of an
attack roll, skill check, saving throw, or ability check.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Skill emphasis.</p>
<p><strong>Cool Under Pressure</strong>: The Dedicated hero selects a number of skills
equal to 3 + the hero&#39;s Wisdom modifier. When making a check with one of
these skills, the Dedicated hero can take 10 even when distracted or
under duress.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Skill emphasis plus either faith or aware.</p>
