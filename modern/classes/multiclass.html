    <h1>Multiclass Characters</h1>
  </header>
  <main><p>A character may add new classes as he or she progresses in levels,
thereby becoming a multiclass character. The class abilities from all of
a character&#39;s classes combine to determine a multiclass character&#39;s
overall abilities.</p>
<section>
<h2 id="class-and-level-features">Class and Level Features</h2>
<p>As a general rule, the abilities of a multiclass character are the sum
of the abilities provided by each of the character&#39;s classes.</p>
<section>
<h3 id="level">Level</h3>
<p>&quot;Character level&quot; is a character&#39;s total number of levels. It is used to
determine when feats and ability score increases are gained</p>
<p>&quot;Class level&quot; is the character&#39;s level in a particular class. For a hero
whose levels are all in the same class, character level and class level
are the same.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h3>
<p>A hero gains hit points from each class as his or her class level
increases, adding the new hit points to the previous total.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="base-attack-bonus">Base Attack Bonus</h3>
<p>Add the base attack bonuses for each class to get the hero&#39;s base attack
bonus. A resulting value of +6 or higher provides the hero with multiple
attacks.</p>

<p>To use multiple attacks in the same round, a character must use a full
attack, which is a full-round action.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="saving-throws">Saving Throws</h3>
<p>Add the base save bonuses for each class together.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="defense-bonus">Defense Bonus</h3>
<p>Add the Defense bonuses for each class together.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="reputation-bonus">Reputation Bonus</h3>
<p>Add Reputation bonuses together.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<p>A multiclass hero uses his or her character level to determine the
maximum ranks the hero can have in a skill. If a skill is a class skill
for any of a multiclass hero&#39;s classes, then use character level to
determine a skill&#39;s maximum rank. (The maximum rank for a class skill is
3 + character level.)</p>
<p>When a multiclass hero gains a level in a class, he or she spends that
level&#39;s skill points as a member of that class. Only that class&#39;s class
skills may be purchased as class skills. All other skills, including
skills for another class the hero has levels in, are considered
cross-class skills when ranks in those skills are purchased at this
level.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="class-features">Class Features</h3>
<p>The character gets all class features (talents, bonus feats, or other
special abilities) of all classes for the levels he or she possesses.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="feats">Feats</h3>
<p>A multiclass character receives a new feat every three character levels,
regardless of individual class level. Taking one level in a new class
does not entitle a character to receive the two feats that a beginning
1st-level character gets.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="ability-increases">Ability Increases</h3>
<p>A multiclass character increases one ability score by +1 every four
character levels, regardless of individual class level.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="adding-a-second-class">Adding a Second Class</h2>
<p>When a character with one class gains a level, he or she may choose to
increase the level of his or her current class or pick up a new class at
1st level. This could be a basic class or, if the character qualifies
for it, an advanced class.</p>
<p>The character gains the 1st-level base attack bonus, base save bonuses,
class skills, other class features of the new class, hit points of the
appropriate die type, and the new class&#39;s number of skill points gained
at each additional level (not that number x4, as is the case for a
1st-level character).</p>
<p>Picking up a new class is not exactly the same as starting a character
in that class. When picking up a new class, a hero doesn&#39;t receive
maximum hit points but should roll the new Hit Die.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="advancing-a-level">Advancing a Level</h2>
<p>Each time a multiclass character attains a new level, the hero either
increases one of his or her current class levels by one or picks up a
new class at 1st level.</p>
<p>When a multiclass character increases one of his or her class levels by
one, the character gets all the standard benefits that characters
receive for attaining the new level in that class: more hit points,
possible bonuses on attack rolls, Defense, and saving throws (depending
on the class and the new level), a new class feature (as defined by the
class), and new skill points.</p>
<p>Skill points are spent according to the class that the multiclass
character just advanced in. Skills are purchased at the cost appropriate
for that class.</p>
<p>In general, a character can have levels in as many different classes as
there are classes.</p>
