    <h1>Advanced Classes</h1>
  </header>
  <main><p>An advanced class represents a focus and a calling for the experienced
adventurer. It provides a specialization and a range of power and
ability to give a character that something extra to set him or her
apart.</p>
<p>Although each advanced class naturally builds from a certain basic
class, every advanced class is available to all characters who fulfill
the prerequisites of the class, regardless of what basic classes they
have gained levels in. The associations between basic classes and
advanced classes are summarized on the following table.</p>

<p>The Gamemaster may add advanced classes specifically suited to his or
her campaign. Conversely, the GM can decide that certain advanced
classes aren&#39;t available in the campaign. Check with your GM before
selecting an advanced class.</p>

<h2 id="qualifying-for-an-advanced-class">Qualifying for an Advanced Class</h2>
<p>Advanced classes are like basic classes, except that they have
requirements that must be met before a character can attain 1st level in
the class. A character who qualifies can choose an advanced class as an
additional class as he or she gains levels, using the multiclassing
rules. Some combination of base attack bonus, feats, and skill ranks
determines whether a character is eligible to gain a level in an
advanced class.</p>
